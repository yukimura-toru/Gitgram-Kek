[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/pokurt/GitGram)

This repository is where the self-hosted, private instance version of GitGram lives. It uses plain webhooks and PTB to receive repository
activity and send it to your groups or to your PMs.

If you ever come here to kang our source code, no support will be given unless you requested to assist you to fix license
issues. Otherwise, instant ban will be given to you without any further notice.

## Setup:
- Install all requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- We recommend to use environment variables to configure your instance. To use it, set `ENV` to `True` and
then cofnigure `APP_URL`, `BOT_TOKEN`, `GITGRAM_SUPPORT`, `GIT_REPO_URL`, and `PROJECT_NAME` variables.
    - If you prefer the old way, edit your `config.py`, but DO NOT COMMIT!
- Run `python3 GitGram.py`
